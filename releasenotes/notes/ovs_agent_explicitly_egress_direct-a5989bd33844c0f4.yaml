    Add new configuration parameter explicitly_egress_direct for ML2 OVS agent
    When set to True, the accepted egress unicast traffic will not use action
    NORMAL. The accepted egress packets will be taken care of in the final
    egress tables direct output flows for unicast traffic so that operators can
    set customized integration bridge name in l3 agent configuration.
    This can be enabled on some nodes to prevent flooding on integration bridge.
