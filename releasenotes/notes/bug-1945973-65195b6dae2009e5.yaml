fixes:
  - |
    The independent ovn plugin package(``pythonN-networking-ovn``) is no longer
    required. The package is no longer available since Ussuri, and all codes
    are now included in the base neutron package.

  - |
    The ``neutron-ovn-metadata-agent`` package is now installed in Ubuntu and
    Debian.
