features:
  - |
    Now ``neutron::server::api_service_name`` can accept and handle ``httpd``
    as a valid service name, to run api service by httpd+mod_wsgi.

upgrade:
  - |
    The ``neutron::server::service_name`` parameter no longer accepts
    ``httpd`` as a valid service name. To run api service by httpd,
    the ``neutron::server::api_service_name`` parameter should be used instead
    along with the ``neutron::server::rpc_service_name``.

deprecations:
  - |
    Usage of arbitaly service name for the ``neutron::server::service_name``
    has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
