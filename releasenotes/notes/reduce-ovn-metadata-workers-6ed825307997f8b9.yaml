    Switched the default value of the ``metadata_workers`` configuration
    option for the OVN metadata agents to 2 (from $::os_workers). While
    the OVS metadata agents runs on the controllers/gateway nodes (and
    defaults to $::os_workers) the OVN metadata agents are distributed
    and runs on the compute nodes instead so, there's no point in running
    dozen of them on each compute. Also, by reducing the number of workers
    we also reduce the burden on the OVSDB that the OVN metadata agent
    connects to making OVN more scalable.
