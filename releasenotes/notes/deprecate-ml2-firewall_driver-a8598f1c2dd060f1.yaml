deprecations:
  - |
    Usage of config option ``firewall_driver`` in the ``neutron::plugins::ml2``
    class is now deprecated and has no effect on the deployment.
    Config option ``firewall_driver`` should be set in the classes for agents'
    configuration like ``neutron::agents::ml2::ovs`` instead.
    Usage of this option in the Neutron server was there just for backward
    compatibility with old agents which can't report what driver they are using.
    Since Newton all Neutron drivers are reporting that in heartbeat messages and
    there is no need to keep configure this in the neutron server's side.
