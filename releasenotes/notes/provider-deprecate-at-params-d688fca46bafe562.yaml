deprecations:
  - |
    The following resource types have been using the credential written in
    the ``[keystone_authtoken]`` section of ``neutron.conf``. However this
    behavior has been deprecated and now these resource types first look for
    the yaml files in ``/etc/openstack/puppet``. Make sure one of
    ``clouds.yaml`` or ``admin-clouds.yaml`` (which is created by
    puppet-keystone) is created in that directory.

    - ``neutron_network``
    - ``neutron_subnet``
    - ``neutron_port``
    - ``neutron_router``
    - ``neutron_router_interface``
    - ``neutron_security_group``
